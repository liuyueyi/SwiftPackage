Instruction
-----------
the package under this directory is the necessory develop tools if you want to start with openstack swift. You can search 'swift all in one' by baidu or google to get the detail information about how to confige the swift environment.

Be attention:
    use the swift.tar.gz python-swiftclient.tar.gz to cover the git source code. Because the newest source code may delete some functions that our project needs. So you should install the swift, swiftclient and swauth use the package here. If you do not know how to install this, please read the README.md or some file like this.

Install develop environment
---------------------------
SwiftProject.tar.gz is the client source code. if you want to run this project, make sure that you have already install pyqt(you can use command: sudo apt-get install libxext6 libxext-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-gui libqt4-sql qt4-dev-tools qt4-doc qt4-designer qt4-qtconfig "python-qt4-*" python-qt4)

Be attention:
    1. You can use eclipse as the develop IDE. So just import the project into your workspace.
    2. The project's GUI is designed by QT designer. So if you want to modify the GUI, just open the file like *.ui, and then use command (pyuic *.ui > o_*.py) to covert the gui file to python file.(the filename can be any you like)
    3. The source code hava not completed. There is no register model, unloged model. And you should also think about how to add key management to this project if you want to work under this project.
    4. There are some bugs that i do not solf. When there is no container under one's private storage, add container may not succeed!
    5. The most important thing is you should add account, member before you use the group storage.
  
  
Add group
---------
First create account:
    swauth-add-account -K swauthkey account_name -G 'gourp_attribute1, attr2' -I 'group instruction information'

Then add member:
    1.just add memeber: swauth-add-user -K swauthkey -a user1 user1 user1
    2.add group: swauth-add-user -K swautkey -a user1 user1 user1 -G 'group1,group2...'
                 swauth-add-user -K swauthkey -a group1 user1 user1 -I 'attr1,attr2..'
